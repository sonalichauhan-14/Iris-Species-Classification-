# Iris-Species-Classification-
This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the Iris dataset to predict flower species based on petal and sepal measurements. The model achieved perfect accuracy and was visualized using scikit-learnâ€™s `plot_tree()` for clear interpretability. It highlights how simple, transparent models can deliver powerful insights in classification tasks.
